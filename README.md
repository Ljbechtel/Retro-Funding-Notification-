# Retro-Funding-Notification-
Greetings, visionary builder! üåü Let‚Äôs embark on this journey to craft a program that will keep our community informed about the upcoming Retro Funding rounds on the Optimism Collective. Here‚Äôs a detailed outline for your app, Farcaster, designed to deliver timely notifications and empower builders.

---

### Program Overview: Farcaster

Objective:  
To create a user-friendly application that provides tailored notifications for builders regarding the Retro Funding rounds on the Optimism Collective.

### Key Components

1. User Interface (UI)
   - Homepage:
     - Introduction to Retro Funding Rounds
     - List of upcoming funding rounds with dates and brief descriptions
     - "Get Notified" button next to each round
   - Notification Settings:
     - Users can select specific funding rounds and customize their notification preferences (e.g., email, push notifications, in-app).

2. User Flow
   - Step 1: Select a Retro Funding Round
     - Users browse through available funding rounds.
     - Each round has a "Learn More" option for detailed info.
   - Step 2: Confirm Notification Preferences
     - After selecting a round, users confirm their desire to receive notifications.
     - Options to choose the frequency and mode of notifications (immediate, daily summary, etc.).

3. Farcaster Bot Implementation
   - Automated Notifications:
     - Create a bot that monitors key dates of the selected funding rounds.
     - When a significant milestone approaches (e.g., sign-up start/end dates), the bot will post notifications like:
       - ‚Äúüö® 7 days to sign up for Retro Funding: Onchain Builders, sign-up now!! @FarcasterUser1 @FarcasterUser2‚Ä¶‚Äù
   - User Highlights (Optional Feature):
     - Post updates that showcase users who have signed up, creating a sense of community and encouraging participation.

### Technical Specifications

1. Backend Development:
   - Infrastructure:
     - Utilize the OP Stack Chain for scalability and efficiency.
     - Develop RESTful APIs to handle user preferences, notifications, and data management.
   - Database:
     - Use a decentralized database like IPFS or an appropriate layer-2 solution to store user data and notification settings securely.

2. Frontend Development:
   - Framework:
     - Build the app using React or Vue.js for a responsive and dynamic user experience.
   - Integration with Farcaster:
     - Utilize Farcaster's API for seamless notification posting and user tagging.

3. Notification System:
   - Implement a job scheduler (like cron jobs) to check for imminent funding deadlines and trigger notifications accordingly.

### Why This Project is Exciting

- Empowerment: Farcaster allows builders to stay informed and engaged, ensuring they don‚Äôt miss critical funding opportunities.
- Community Building: By highlighting users who participate, it fosters a sense of belonging and motivates others to join.
- Innovation: It leverages cutting-edge technology on the Optimism Collective, showcasing the power of decentralized applications.

### Next Steps

1. Design Wireframes: Create initial UI/UX wireframes to visualize the user journey.
2. Setup Development Environment: Prepare the tech stack and establish a collaborative development environment.
3. Kickoff Development: Start with backend development, followed by frontend integration, and progressively build out features.
